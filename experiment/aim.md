The students will be able to understand the concept of multiplexers and its implementation using logic gates. The students will be able to understand the concept of encoder.

Students will be able:
1.  To select appropriate gates  to build a multiplexer circuit.
2.	To identify the role of a multiplexer circuit.
3.	To design, construct and verify the operation of a 2:1 multiplexer using basic logic gates.
