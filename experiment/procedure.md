1. Click on "Start Quiz".
2. Click on the appropriate gate.
3. Click on "Check answer".
4. If answer is correct, click "Go to next question".
5. If answer is incorrect, "Wrong gate selected" pops up, click ok to try again and proceed.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 and complete the quiz.
7. In first attempt if all 3 questions are answered correctly, you get an overall score of 5 points. For any incorrect answers the points are deducted.

<b>Simulation Screen 4: Simulator Scene - To design, construct and verify the operation of a 2:1 multiplexer using basic logic gates. </b><br>
Assume the enable input is activated (i.e. it is already set to zero)
<b>General instructions:</b>
1. Apply the function table/Boolean expression in Screen 3 to design a 2:1 mux.
2. Click on the required object (AND, OR, NOT gate, digital switch, LED, connection wires) and click on canvas to place the component on canvas one by one.
3. Every component is treated as an object with one/two inputs and one output.
4. Digital switch output is connected as input. Click on ‘output 1 to input 1’ wire to connect the output to the first input of next gate, whereas ‘output 1 to input 2’ wire to connect the output to second input of gate.
5. Y connector has one input and two outputs. When same input is to be connected at two places, use a y connector accordingly.
6. Do connections as per the design.
7. Use undo link/undo gate or redo link/gate to make corrections if any.
8. Start simulator.
9. Set select input S0 and data inputs Do & D1 and verify the corresponding outputs.
10. Compare the output of the design against the corresponding output in the function table of 2:1 mux given on right hand side and validate your design.
